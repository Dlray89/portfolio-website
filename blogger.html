					<h5>Life is your stage! <br> written on: 01/10/2020 </h5>
					</span>
					<p> You ever just sit back and think about how life is very artistic and dramatic. We all know about
						the tough challenges that we face after we leave our parent's house. I'm 30 years of age and in
						my twenty i've realized one thing, and that was life was literally like a live stage. Look I
						came to this realization one day that I needed to change a few things about myself after reading this
						quote.
						<br>
						<br>
						
						The words of the great William Shakespeare:
						
						<p>” All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players: they have their exits and
						their entrances, And one man in his time plays many parts, His acts being seven ages.”</p>

						<br>
						<br>
						
						<p>You see how deep that quote is? I literally thought about everything I do and rebuilt how I did them. We are all merely actors in this play called life, and we must know what roles to play to
							live the life we want to live. If you don't know what roles you are supposed to play in life
							and good place to start looking is back into your past and discovering your childhood inclination. Let that
							inclination guide you to your life's task. Be who you want to be but make sure you don't lose yourself in the process.</p>

							<h5>Developer's Web! <br> written on: 01/11/2020 </h5>
							</span>

							<p>As I sit here and ponder where my life is headed in the next few months, I can't help but to think about how
								I am growing tremendously in life and how I see the world.
								I'm able to handle tough challenges that life herself throws at me and one of the most
								remarkable things that stands out to me, is how I can manage my feelings and think about
								an effective plan to combat those situations. This is one reason why I am caught in this developers
								web and can't get out. Hey, I'll stay as long as I can because I love the problem solving aspect of coding.
								
								<br>
								<br>
								
								I think it's hilarious, how I don't get any sleep and how involved I am with this. You see once I decide to get into web development
								and software development it has put my problem solving skills on a whole new level. I became
								stuck and obsessed with front end/back end designs
								and all aspects of network security. I love how the front end of web development
								challenges my creativity and back end challenges my technical skills. You see this web
								has given me a tangible skill that has added value in my life.
								<br>
								<br>
								I taught myself how to code and things got really complicated, way to quick. I kept at it with full force,
								determine to learn what this wonderful obsession was in front of me. Months after teaching myself how to code I came
								across a fantastic opportunity with Lambda Schools. The opportunity this School gives people are simply beautiful
								and very beneficial to one's life. I will continue this passion of mines and stretch this as far as I can and hone my skills. 

							<br>
							<br>

							I think I'll stay here in this developers web!

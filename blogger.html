									</span><p> You ever just sit back and think about how life is very artistic and dramatic. We all know about the tough challenges that we face after we 
											leave our parent's house. I'm 30 years of age and in my 20's I've realized one thing, and that was Life was literally like a live stage. 
											I came to this realization when I read the quote by William Shakespeare.</p><br>
												
											<p>The quote said</p><br>
											<p>"All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players: they have their exits and their entrances, And one man in his time 
											   plays many parts, His acts being seven ages." <br>
												-William Shakespear"
											</p>
											
											<p>
												We are all merely actors in this play called Life and we must know what roles to play to live the life we want to live. If you don't 
												know what roles you are supposed to play in life and good play to start and look is back at your past and look into your future. Be who 
												you want to be but make sure you don't lose yourself in the process.</p>

									</span>

									<p>As I sit here and ponder where my life is headed in the next few months, I realized that I am growing tremendously in life. I see the world a lot different <br>
														and I'm able to handle tough challenges that life herself throws at me. One of the biggest things that stood out is how I'm caught in this what I like to call the developer's web. <br>
														You see once I decide to get into web development and Network security it has out my determination on a whole new level. I became obsessed with front end/back end designs and all aspect of network <br>
														security. I love how the front end of web development challenges my creativity and back end challenges my technical skills, which I love. You see this web has given me a tangible skill that has added <br>
														value in my life. I taught myself how to code and things got a little too complicated. So I hopped online to look up ways to better learn and understand the back end side of web development. Lambda School <br> 
														was the first to pop up. I simply love what they had to offer and I saw it as an opportunity to upgrade my current skills and learn new ones.
													</p>
					
													<p>
														With that being said my journal has been exciting and I can't honestly wait to see what I can accomplish here in the next few weeks.

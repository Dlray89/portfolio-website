									</span><p> You ever just sit back and think about how life is very artistic and dramatic. We all know about the tough challenges that we face after we leave our parent's house. I'm 30 years of age and in my twenty. I've realized one thing, and that was Life was literally like a live stage. Look I came to this realization that I needed to change a few things about myself after reading this quote. Let me share the quote with you.

									<p>The quote said:</p>
										
										<p>All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players: they have their exits and their entrances, And one man in his time plays many parts, His acts being seven ages by William Shakespeare </p>
										
										 <p>We are all merely actors in this play called life, and we must know what roles to play to live the life we want to live. If you don't know what roles you are supposed to play in life and good play to start and look is back at your past and look into your future. Be who you want to be but make sure you don't lose yourself in the process.</p>

									</span>

									<p>As I sit here and ponder where my life is headed in the next few months, I realized that I am growing tremendously in life and I see the world a lot different.
										I'm able to handle tough challenges that life herself throws at me. One of the most remarkable things that stands out to me, is how I'm caught in this thing called 'developer's web'.
										Corny right? I think it's hilrious, you see once I decide to get into web development and software development it has put my determination on a whole new level. I became stuck and obsessed with front end/back end designs 
										and all aspects of network security. I love how the front end of web development challenges my creativity and back end challenges my technical skills. You see this web has given me a tangible
										skill that has added value in my life. I taught myself how to code and things got a little too complicated. I hopped online to look up ways to better my understanding of computer languages and to completely understand the backend side of web development. Lambda School was the first to pop up. I simply love what they had to offer and I saw it as an opportunity to upgrade and hone my current skills and learn new ones.
										To be honest my journal has been exciting and I can't honestly wait to see what I can accomplish here in the next few weeks.
